Dealing data and complex business logic encapsulation represent a productization opportunity for global firms.

## Overview

This project aims to leverage dbt (data build tool) for transforming and analyzing financial data in the capital markets sector. It focuses on calculating key financial metrics such as equity and debt ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, and interest coverage ratios, among others. The project is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for the integration of various data feeds and the porting of complex financial logic into dbt models.
Data Feeds

The project supports integration with structured data sources that contain financial statements and related financial data. These data feeds can come from various sources, including:

    Databases: Relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or cloud-based databases such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake.
    CSV Files: Financial data stored in CSV files, which can be loaded into a database for analysis.
    Web Scraping: Extracted financial data from PDFs or web pages, stored in a structured format for analysis.
    APIs: Financial data providers offering APIs for programmatically accessing financial statements.

## Components

    Data Ingestion: The process of loading financial data from various sources into a centralized database. This could involve ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for CSV files, web scraping for PDFs, or direct API calls for financial data.

    dbt Models: A collection of SQL and Jinja-templated dbt models that transform raw financial data into meaningful financial metrics. These models encapsulate financial logic and calculations, such as equity and debt ratios.

    Data Analysis: The use of dbt to run these models and generate insights from the financial data. This could involve creating dashboards or reports in a BI (Business Intelligence) tool for further analysis.

    Integration Layer: A layer that integrates with external systems, such as Salesforce, to fetch and update financial data in real-time. This could involve custom dbt models that connect to Salesforce data sources.

## To-Do List for Porting into dbt

    Data Modeling: Define the structure of the financial data in the database, including tables for different types of financial statements and related data.

    dbt Models Development: Develop dbt models for calculating key financial metrics. This includes models for equity and debt ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, and interest coverage ratios.

    Data Validation: Implement data validation checks within dbt models to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the financial data.

    Integration with External Systems: Develop dbt models that integrate with external data sources, such as Salesforce, to fetch and update financial data in real-time.

    Testing: Create tests for dbt models to ensure they produce the expected results and handle edge cases gracefully.

    Documentation: Document the dbt models, data sources, and the overall project architecture. This includes creating a README.md file and additional documentation as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to:

    Set up your dbt project and configure your data sources.
    Load your financial data into the database.
    Develop and test your dbt models.
    Integrate with external systems as needed.

## Conclusion

This project represents a powerful approach to financial analysis in the capital markets sector, leveraging the flexibility and scalability of dbt. By integrating various data feeds and porting complex financial logic into dbt models, this project enables teams to derive valuable insights from financial data efficiently and effectively.
